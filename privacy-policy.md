# Privacy Policy - Worldwide
Last updated: November 6, 2017

#### Welcome!

Privacy and online safety are extremely import to Hydal. We offer a platform for discovering products at at low prices across retailers. We collect data about our users when they use our platform. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use and disclose Data.

In this privacy policy, we sometimes refer to “You”. “__You__” may be a visitor to one of our websites, a user of one or more of our Services (“__User__”). We’ll do our best to clarify who we are referring to at various points in the policy. If You disagree with the practices described in this policy, You should (a) take the necessary steps to remove cookies from Your computer after leaving our website, and (b) discontinue Your use of our Services. Finally, we have also put together a [Cookie Policy](https://github.com/hydal/policies/master/cookie-policy.md) that describes in detail how we use cookies and similar technologies.


### 1. Overview.

The Data we collect depends on how our Services are used. Sometimes we receive Data directly, such as when a Hydal account is created, or we receive an email. Other times, we get Data by recording interactions with our Services, for example, cookies. We also get Data from third parties, like our identity verification services. The collection of and use of data is essential for our ability to provide our Services, and to help keep the Services safe.



### 2. Data We Collect.

__a. Personal Data__. We call Data that identifies, or that could reasonably be used to identify, You as an
individual “__Personal Data__”. We receive Personal Data from identity verification services. Personal Data does
not include Data that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably
associated with a specific person. The Personal Data that we may collect includes:

* __Contact details__, name and email address only.

b. __Other Data__. We call Data other than Personal Data "__Other Data__". We collect Other Data through a variety
of sources. One of our sources for Other Data is cookies and other technologies that record Data about the
use of our website. Other Data that we may collect include:

* __Browser and device data__, such as IP address, device type, operating system and Internet browser type,
  screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, and language.

* __Cookie and tracking technology data__, such as pages visited.


### 3. How We Use Data.

__a. Personal Data__. We use Personal Data to: (i) provide the Services; (ii) promote, analyze and improve
our products, systems and tools. Examples of how we may use Personal Data include:

* To respond to inquiries, send service notices and provide customer support;
* To develop new products;
* To send marketing communications;
* To improve or modify our Services; and
* To conduct aggregate analysis and develop business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect,
  make informed decisions, and report on the performance of, our business.

__b. Other Data__. We may use Other Data for a range of different purposes, provided we comply with
applicable law. In some countries (for example, European Economic Area countries), local legal regimes
may require us to treat some or all of Other Data as “personal data” under applicable data protection
laws. Where this is the case, we will process Other Data only for the same purposes as Personal Data
under this privacy policy.



### 4. How We Disclose Data.

Hydal does not sell or rent Personal Data to marketers or untrusted third parties. The only Personal Data
we share with trusted third parties includes:

__a. To Hydal Service Providers__. We share Data with services providers who help us provide the Services. This is
   only data analysis and nothing else.

__b. Safety, Legal Purposes and Law Enforcement__. We use and disclose Data as we believe necessary: (i) under
  applicable law, or payment method rules; (ii) to enforce our terms and conditions; (iii) to protect our
  rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, You or others; and (iv) to respond
  to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government
  authorities, which may include authorities outside Your country of residence.


### 5. Security.

We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Data within
our organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
If You have reason to believe that Your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if You feel
that the security of Your account or the Website has been compromised), please [contact us](https://hydal.xyz) immediately.
